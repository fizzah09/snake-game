# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented using Python and Tkinter GUI library. The player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food pellets to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the game window or with its own body.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the `snake_game.py` file.
   ```
   python snake_game.py
   ```

2. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
3. The snake will automatically move in the chosen direction.
4. Guide the snake to eat the food pellets represented by red squares.
5. Each time the snake eats a pellet, it grows longer and the score increases.
6. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the game window or with its own body.

## Features

- Responsive arrow key controls for directing the snake.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.
- Game over screen displaying a message when the game ends.

## Dependencies

This game requires Python 3.x and the Tkinter library, which is usually included with Python installations.
